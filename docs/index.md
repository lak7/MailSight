## **Oblivion<sup>-1</sup>** ~ A Simple E-mail Tracker

üéØÔ∏è Oblivion-Inverse is a simple e-mail tracking solution which based on the usage of web beacons or tracking pixels.  
> A¬†web beacon (web bug)¬†is a technique used on¬†web pages¬†and¬†emails¬†to unobtrusively (usually invisibly) allow checking that a user has accessed some content.¬†Web beacons are typically used by third parties to monitor the activity of users at a website for the purpose of¬†web analytics¬†or¬†page tagging. They can also be used for¬†email tracking. - Wikipedia

## ü§îÔ∏è What can I achieve using this?

Basically using this pixel tracking method you can obtain vast amount of information about the targets. But, when it comes to emails there are few restrictions. For an instance, JavaScripts are not generally allowed in email clients.

- ‚úÖ IP address of the recipient's device (or the proxy)  

- ‚úÖÔ∏è Request Header - User-Agent (*Browser, Operating System, Device information*)  
Ex: `Mozilla/5.0 (Linux; Android 11; Nokia G10) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/91.0.4472.88 Mobile Safari/537.36`  

- ‚úÖÔ∏è Additionally, you can use a Geo Location API to obtain information such as *approximate location, country, ISP ( Internet Service Provider), whether the user is using a VPN/Tor and so on...* ) [Read how to use a Geo Location API section](https://github.com/Dilshan-H/Oblivion-Inverse#%EF%B8%8F-how-to-use-a-geo-location-api)

## ‚öôÔ∏è Setup & Usage

### Basic Requirements
- Python3 and Pip
- Git  
    - https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git  
    - https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-First-Time-Git-Setup

- Heroku Account & Heroku CLI (or suitable platform)  
If you're willing to use **Heroku**, here they have explained all the steps for getting started with python apps.
    - https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/getting-started-with-python
- Code Editor (such as VS Code)

### üì•Ô∏è Installation
1. First clone or download this repository as a Zip file to your local machine.

2. Navigate to the directory.
    ```bash
    cd Oblivion-Inverse
    ```

3. Create a virtual environment.
    ```python
    python3 -m venv ./
    ```

4. Activate virtual environment.  
    
   *Linux:*
   ```bash
    source bin/activate
    ```
    *Windows:*
    ```bash
    Scripts\activate
    ```

5. Install dependencies.
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

6. Change the time zone used in `routes.py`:
    ```python
    # Line 23
    generatedOn = str(dt.now().astimezone(pytz.timezone('Use-Your-Time-Zone-Here')))

    # Line 78
    accessedOn = str(dt.now().astimezone(pytz.timezone('Use-Your-Time-Zone-Here')))
    ```
    To choose the correct time zone, you can query all the supported time zones like this;
    ```python
    import pytz
    pytz.all_timezones
    ``` 

After that you can either test the application in your local machine or setup your selected platform as you wish. 

### üñ•Ô∏è <u>Testing/Using on your Local Machine | Network</u>  

If you have selected the first option then you have to issue following commands;

```bash
export FLASK_ENV=development
export DATABASE_URL="sqlite:///data.db"
export SECRET_KEY="replace-this-text-with-a-suitable-key"
python3
```
```python
import flask
from app import db
from models import db
db.create_all()
```
Next let's create a password hash for your user account:

```python
from werkzeug.security import generate_password_hash
userPassword = generate_password_hash('YOUR-PASSWORD', method='sha256')
```

Then we can add the new user to the database:

```python
from models import Users
user = Users(username="YOUR-USERNAME", password=userPassword)
db.session.add(user)
db.session.commit()
```

Then hit '**ctrl + z**' to quit from Python and start your development server:

```bash
flask run
```
Navigate to `localhost:5000` in your browser.  
If another program is already utilizing port 5000, `Address already in use` error will be displayed.
If that happens you can specify a different port like this:
```bash
flask run --port 5001
```

A login page will be displayed.  
Input your newly created username & password and that's it!  

### üöÄÔ∏è <u>Deploying on Heroku Cloud Platform</u>  

If you're willing to use Heroku cloud platform, here's how to do that:
(A Heroku account, Heroku CLI and Git will be needed. [Read Basic Requirements](https://github.com/Dilshan-H/Oblivion-Inverse#basic-requirements))

Change **line 20** in `tracking_data.html` according to your app name.
```html
<code>&lt;img src="https://your-app-name.herokuapp.com/track?utm_id={{ data.utmId }}"/></code>
```

If you have made any changes (such as changing the Timezone in `routes.py`) to the source code, commit those changes using `git add .` and `git commit -m "commit-message"`

1. Login to Heroku.
    ```bash
    heroku login
    ```
    
2. Create a heroku app.
    ```bash
    heroku create YOUR-APP-NAME
    ```

3. Next deploy the app:
    ```bash
    git push heroku main
    ```
    This will take a while to finish. After deploying we have to add **Heroku PostgreSQL** add-on:
    
    ```bash
    heroku addons:create heroku-postgresql:hobby-dev
    ```
    
4. Then we have to create our database and add a new user account on the remote server. But before that we need to setup environment variables on Heroku.  
   Add
   SECRET_KEY as follows;
   ```bash
   heroku config:set SECRET_KEY=replace-this-text-with-a-suitable-key
   ```
   After that issue following commands in the terminal;
    ```bash
    heroku run python3
    ```
    ```python
    import flask
    from app import db
    from models import db
    db.create_all()
    
    from werkzeug.security import generate_password_hash
    userPassword = generate_password_hash('YOUR-PASSWORD', method='sha256')
    
    from models import Users
    user = Users(username="YOUR-USERNAME", password=userPassword)
    db.session.add(user)
    db.session.commit()
    
    quit()
    ```
    ```bash
    heroku open
    ```
Alright - Now your app must be online!
If every thing went smoothly; a login page will be displayed.  
Input your newly created username & password and that's it!

## üè∑Ô∏è Steps to create a tracking link for your email.  

1. Visit the homepage of the app and sign into your account.
   
2. First add a suitable title for your message. You can add the subject of the specific email which will make it easier to identified at later times.

3. Then click '**Generate**'

4. Then, you can drag & drop the tracking image to the end of your message body. (**DO NOT copy & paste the image** since it will insert your image as a base64 image to the email body)  
Otherwise, you can manipulate the content of the email body using Developer Tools in browser.

5. Everything's done! Now send your email and wait for the results to appear. (you need to refresh your browser to load new entries)


## üåêÔ∏è How to use a Geo Location API

Using a Geo Location API, you can collect additional information about the recipient such as;
- Approximate location
- Country
- ISP ( Internet Service Provider)
- VPN/Tor Usage ...

In `routes.py` line 70 to 75 contains a simple API usage that can be altered according to your opinions. Please note that **ipwhois** service has certain limitations (like amount of requests) which may eventually cause errors. So, you can choose a better API which fit into your needs.

#### **üìåÔ∏è Special note about G-Mail**  
Since Google uses a special technique, "Image Proxies" to deliver images; this pixel based tracking method is not suitable to gather additional information about the recipients who use G-Mail. Instead of recipient's IP address and User-Agent, you will receive Google Image Proxy‚Äôs UA (User-Agent) and IP address which looks like this:

`Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 5.1; rv:11.0) Gecko Firefox/11.0 (via ggpht.com GoogleImageProxy)`

But, on the bright side, you can still get the resource accessed date and time!

#### **üìåÔ∏è Why not using cookies for tracking?**  
Yes, you can set cookies for additional/accurate data collection. But they represent as third party cookies within devices. Most of the web browsers/platforms block such cookies by default. [maybe not Chrome :)] So, it's the death of 3<sup>rd</sup> party cookies. But you can try!
